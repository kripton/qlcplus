<H1>E1.31 input/output plugin</H1>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>
QLC+ supports the <a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/E1.31">E1.31 protocol</a> (also known as sACN)
through an input/output plugin that receives and transmits packets on the network.<br>
No extra requirements are needed, since QLC+ has a native implementation of the E1.31 protocol
that works on Linux, Windows and OSX systems.<br>
The E1.31 plugin can send and receive packets from multiple network cards, virtual addresses, 
the loopback device (127.0.0.1) and multiple universes per network interface.<br>
By default, E1.31 packets will be sent as UDP on multicast addresses like 239.255.0.x, 
where 'x' is the universe number selected in QLC+. The port used is 5568.<br>
When using the loopback device packets are always transmitted using address 127.0.0.1.<br>
When transmitting multiple universes on the same interface, the packets will be sent by default with an E1.31
Universe ID equal to the QLC+ universe number minus 1.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
QLC+ Universe 1 --> E1.31 Universe 0<br>
QLC+ Universe 2 --> E1.31 Universe 1<br>
...<br>
QLC+ Universe 8 --> E1.31 Universe 7<br>
<br>
If the above settings don't meet the requirements of your network, please read the following chapter.

<H1>Configuration</H1>

<P>
When clicking on the <IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png" width=32> configuration button,
a small dialog will be displayed, showing the Universes Configuration panel.<br>
<br>
<u>After</u> a QLC+ universe is patched with an E1.31 input or output, an entry will be displayed in this list, 
allowing to manually configure the desired parameters to be used by the E1.31 plugin.<br>
Input lines do not have particular parameters, while an output line can be configured wth the following:<br>
<ul>
 <li><b>IP Address</b>: This is the destination IP address where the E1.31 plugin will transmit packets to. By default
     a multicast address is used as described above. By setting this parameter within the 1-255 range, E1.31 will
     transmit a QLC+ universe to the desired multicast address.<br>
     When patching a QLC+ universe to the loopback device (127.0.0.1), packets will be always transmitted to 127.0.0.1.
  </li>
  <li><b>E1.31 Universe</b>: This is the E1.31 universe that will be actually written in every packet transmitted.
     By setting this parameter, you can use any QLC+ universe to transmit to the desired E1.31 universe.
  </li>
  <li><b>Transmission Mode</b>: Here you can select if QLC+ should transmit full or partial universes.<br>
     'Full' means that all the 512 DMX channels of a universe are transmitted at the speed rate of the QLC+
     internal clock (50Hz), producing a fixed bitrate of about 200Kbit/s.<br>
     'Partial', instead, means that QLC+ will transmit only the DMX channel actually used in a universe,
     starting from channel 1. For example if you raise channel 3 of a fixture with address 50, the E1.31 plugin
     will transmit only 53 DMX channels, thus limiting the trasnmission bitrate. Use this setting only if the
     receiving E1.31 node supports partial transmission.
  </li>
</ul>
Settings that are different from the plugin defaults, will be stored in your QLC+ workspace, to increase the
portability of a project across different platforms, such as different operating systems or a PC and a Raspberry Pi.

<H1>Compatibility</H1>

<P>
QLC+ has been tested with the following E1.31 softwares/devices:
